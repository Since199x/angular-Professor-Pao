        The cat (Felis catus, or Felis silvestris catus, literally "woodland cat"),[4][1][5] often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish from other felids and felines, is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. It is often called house cat[6] when kept as indoor pet or feral/feral domestic cat when wild.[7] It is often valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.
